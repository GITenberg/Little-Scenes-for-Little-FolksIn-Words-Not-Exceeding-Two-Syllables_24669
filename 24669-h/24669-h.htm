<h2>GO-ING TO CHURCH.</h2>


<p>How neat and nice this lit-tle boy and his sis-ter
look, go-ing in their Sun-day clothes to church!
The lit-tle girl has, I dare say, her prayer book in
her bag, and her bro-ther has his un-der his arm.
They seem by their fa-ces, to be good chil-dren,
and ap-pear ve-ry fond of each oth-er. They
have been taught by their kind pa-rents, that it is
their du-ty to at-tend di-vine wor-ship, and pray
to God, and the lit-tle girl is point-ing out to her
broth-er the poor old wo-man on her way to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>church, and seems to be prais-ing her good-ness.</p>

<h2>PRET-TY POLL.</h2>


<p>Up-on my word, this is a ve-ry pret-ty look-ing
par-rot, and the children seem much pleas-ed with
it. I hope they ne-ver play a-ny tricks with it,
or try to tease it, for par-rots when an-gry can
bite pret-ty hard. Poll and her young friends
seem to be quite on good terms, but I should not
like to have my fin-ger so near her bill, unless I
were cer-tain of her be-ing in a good hu-mour.
Par-rots a-muse us much by their be-ing able to

<h2>THE FLOW-ER GAR-DEN.</h2>


<p>What a pret-ty scene a flow-er gar-den af-fords!
Roses, tu-lips, wall-flowers, and ma-ny oth-ers,
a-like pleasing to the sight and the smell. The
lit-tle boy de-serves to en-joy all the plea-sure
that the gar-den can pro-cure him; for he is at
work with his tools, his spade, his bar-row, and
his roll-ing stone, which shews a de-sire of mak-ing
him-self use-ful. I be-lieve, too, he has kind-ly
gi-ven his eld-est sis-ter the rose at which she
is smell-ing, and he will I have no doubt, help the
young-est in fill-ing her bas-ket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>THE NEW DOLL.</h2>


<p>We must con-fess that the lit-tle lass with the
doll in her hand, makes a ve-ry cle-ver and care-ful
nurse. She is shew-ing her new trea-sure to
her friend on her right with no small de-gree of
pride, at which we need not won-der, nor at the
man-ner in which the oth-er ap-pears to ad-mire
it, for it is a ve-ry hand-some af-fair. It must
have cost the lit-tle girl's pa-pa and ma-ma a great
deal of mo-ney, and I hope she will know how to
va-lue and take care of it, and not throw it a-bout
af-ter she has had it a lit-tle while, and get tir-ed
of it, as I have known some silly children do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>A WALK WITH MA-MA.</h2>


<p>This lit-tle boy and girl, may ve-ry well be in
high spi-rits. Their ma-ma is not of-ten a-ble to
go out with them, for the in-fant takes up a great
deal of her time, and she has ma-ny oth-er things
to at-tend to at home, so that the chil-dren most-ly
walk with the ser-vant. But to-day, ma-ma is
at lei-sure, and they have set out for a nice walk
in the fields, ba-by and all. The child-ren seem
rea-dy to skip with de-light, and e-ven Tray shares
in their joy. We wish the par-ty much pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>A RIDE WITH MA-MA.</h2>


<p>Well, this is a tru-ly sty-lish set-out. The pair
of long-tailed hor-ses are per-fect beau-ties, and
the post-lad has no need to use the whip to them.
I do not won-der that the lit-tle folks enjoy their
ride so much, in such a nice car-riage, and through
such a love-ly coun-try, and, above all as they are
a-long with their kind ma-ma, who is point-ing out
all that she thinks like-ly to a-muse them. I am
sure they have been good chil-dren, or their ma-ma
would not have ta-ken them with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PET LAMB.</h2>


<p>What a pret-ty, tame, gen-tle crea-ture and
how fond-ly its young mis-tress seems to ca-ress
it. Yet I am al-most a-fraid that her kind-ness is
car-ried to ex-cess, and that she hugs the lamb
ra-ther too close for its com-fort. In-deed its
looks near-ly ex-press as much. Her bro-ther
ap-pears ful-ly to share in her fond-ness for the
lamb. He has a bas-ket of gay flowers stand-ing
on the ground be-side him, and is making a gar-land
for the neck of the pet, which when, dress-ed
out, will no doubt cut a ve-ry smart fi-gure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHARLES'S NEW <ins title="changed comma to period">BOAT.</ins></h2>


<p>Our young sail-or has just launch-ed his new
ves-sel, and a ve-ry neat and trim one it is. The
rig-ging is in good or-der, and the wind fills the
spread-ing sails brave-ly. The grace and beau-ty
of the bark seems great-ly to de-light Charles, as
well as his two sis-ters, who have come to par-take
in the plea-sure of the scene. I do not
know what car-go the ves-sel has on board, but I
think there is not much dan-ger of her be-ing
wreck-ed, as she is not like-ly to sail far out of
her mas-ter's care and sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<h2>KIND-NESS TO THE POOR.</h2>


<p>What a plea-sure it is to see chil-dren with
good and kind hearts. How the sweet lit-tle girl
ap-pears to pi-ty the poor in-firm old wo-man to
whom she is giv-ing her pen-ny, and so does her
broth-er who has be-fore giv-en his share of re-lief.
And their good ma-ma stands look-ing on with
de-light, as she may well do, at the con-duct of
her off-spring. If we did but re-flect on the com-forts
which God al-lows us to en-joy, while so
ma-ny poor crea-tures are in want and sick-ness
and sor-row, we should al-ways be glad to shew
our-selves grate-ful to him by help-ing those who
are in dis-tress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PET DOG.</h2>


<p>Stand up, Pom-pey! You are on-ly half a
sol-di-er yet. You have got your gun in your
hand, but we must put your hel-met on be-sides
to make you com-plete. Poor Pom-pey! he is
as peace-ful and quiet as a lamb, and willing to do
a-ny thing that he can which he is told to do.
The chil-dren round him seem kind and fond of
him, and I trust they will not keep him stand-ing
long, be-cause, though it may a-muse them to see
him play a trick or two, this pos-ture is not easy
to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE ROCK-ING HORSE.</h2>


<p>This is a fa-mous dash-ing steed, and he ap-pears
to have a ve-ry smart, ac-tive young ri-der.
He has a firm and grace-ful seat, and has his reins
well in hand. He rides too with a great deal of
cou-rage, al-though we must ad-mit that his charg-er
is not like-ly to swerve from the course which
he wish-es him to keep, nor, though go-ing at full
gal-lop, is there any dan-ger of his be-ing thrown
or run a-way with by the do-cile crea-ture on
which he is mount-ed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE POOR BLACK.</h2>


<p>In some parts of the world, where the sun is
ve-ry hot, the skins of the peo-ple, in-stead of
be-ing white, like ours, are quite black; these
folks are call-ed ne-groes. Some wick-ed men
take them from their homes, and make them slaves
and ill-treat them; and ma-ny sil-ly chil-dren are
a-fraid of them, be-cause they seem ugly. I am
glad to see that our young friends have been taught
bet-ter. They are look-ing with pi-ty at the poor
black man, and the lit-tle one is giv-ing him some
re-lief. They know that God made all men of all
col-ours, and that we are all e-qual be-fore him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE NEW SHOES.</h2>


<p>Yes, baby is smart in-deed now. How proud
she is of her new shoes, and how ea-ger she is to
put out her lit-tle feet to shew them to her bro-ther
and sis-ter, who seem scarce-ly less pleas-ed than
her-self. Her ma-ma too looks with de-light up-on
the plea-sure her ba-by feels, and for-gets all
the trou-ble she her-self has had. I do not know
how chil-dren can be grate-ful e-nough to their
kind parents who thus pro-vide for all their
wants and plea-sures in their help-less age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE BRO-KEN DOLL.</h2>


<p>Here is a sad piece of mis-chief, and, if I am
right in my guess, Mad-am Puss, by the man-ner
in which she is scud-ding out of the room is the
au-thor of it. I sus-pect that, while the doll was
ly-ing upon the stool, the cat be-gan to play with
its long clothes, till she pull-ed it down on the
floor, where it got broken as we see. Care might
have spar-ed this loss. If the lit-tle girl, be-fore
go-ing to her mu-sic, had put the doll in a high
place out of puss's reach, all would have been
safe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h2>CLE-VER CHARLES AND STEA-DY JANE.</h2>


<p>This is a sight worth look-ing at. No one i-dle
but all mak-ing some good use of their time.
Ma-ma is sett-ing a good pat-tern. She is bu-sy
in read-ing while lit-tle Jane is work-ing close-ly
at her needle, and her el-der bro-ther Charles is
tak-ing on the Globe the mea-sure of the dis-tance
be-tween two pla-ces. Their ma-ma must
feel much plea-sure in see-ing her chil-dren em-ploy
them-selves so well, and af-ter their work is
o-ver, they will en-joy their play, when they go
to it, more than la-zy folks can ever do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE MORN-ING LES-SON.</h2>


<p>We need not ask wheth-er these two chil-dren

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
